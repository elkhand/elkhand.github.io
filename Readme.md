# My blog

This is my blog, uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). 

This blog's css/rss is mainly forked from Andrew Karpathy's blog. 

I will share the daily problem solving challenges which i faced and solved - with intention to save common human time which could have been spent on the same problem.
