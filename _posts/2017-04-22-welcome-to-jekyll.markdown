Started new blog, where will share the daily problem solving challenges which i faced and solved - with intention to save common human time which could have been spent on the same problem.

Started with wordpress.com, ended up with Jekyll blog.

I started my 1st blog on Wordpress.com, but in the second blog, when i needed to insert table into my post, my wordpress.com journey has ended, as they did not have simple way of adding table into the blog post.

Another option i wanted to have Google Analytics in my blogs, which was also not possible in wordpress.com's basic subscription.

With Jekyll you have full control of your blog, data & design. Using Disqus for comment funcitonality and Google Analytics, is all i wanted to start simple blog.

I forked from Andrew Karpathy's github repo, I liked his blog's simplest design(but knowledgeful content :)

I added my own parts (pagination, comment count, different icons for social media).
